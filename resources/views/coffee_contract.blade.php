           <p><b>PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT CAREFULLY: Do not accept the terms of this contract unless you or your business are able to adhere and meet to all the criteria and terms below.</b></p>

            <p>Thank you for choosing KoolBeans and welcome to our site and services. The contract we have compiled below is set up to protect you and our customers and provide each of you with the best experience and service possible.

            <b><h2>Criteria</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>You are a UK registered business and are described as a Coffee Shop or Café where you sell Coffee, Tea, Hot Chocolate, Smoothies or Iced Drinks as a main product</li>

                <li>You are an independent coffee shop or you are a small chain of shops*</li>

                <li>You USE a traditional espresso machine for any espresso based drinks</li>

                <li>All coffee is ground on site (Bean to Cup service)</li>

                <li>Your machine is not a pre-set vending or push button operated machine (Espresso machines with button operated shot size controls ARE acceptable)</li>

                <li>You DO NOT use coffee pods or freeze dried/granule/instant coffee</li>

                <li>You USE fresh milk for any milk based drinks</li>

                <li>Your machine is NOT coin operated</li>

                <li>You provide a takeaway service</li>

                <li>You have a Smartphone, Tablet, Laptop or similar internet connected device present at or behind the counter in order to receive orders</li>
            </ul></b>

            <p>To become a KoolBeans partner store you need to be either; a coffee shop or sell coffee as a main product and use an espresso machine or similar to produce your coffee. Selling cups of instant coffee from your bedroom will not meet the requirements.</p>

            <p><b>*if you are unsure about any of the requirements above and whether your shop/s meet them. Please contact our support team on <a href="mailto:support@koolbeans.co.uk">support@koolbeans.co.uk.</a></b></p>

            <p>Membership is free with no contracts. You can stay as long as you like.</p>

            <p><b>Sales Commission</b></p>

            <p>6% commission on sales through KoolBeans plus Stripe fees.</p>

            <h2><b>Feedback</b></h2>

            <p>While we like to think we do everything brilliantly, we expect that this won’t always be the case. We welcome all feedback - good or bad - as we are always looking at ways to improve our service.</p>
